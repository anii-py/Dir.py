 ## Why did i make this tool ?
 
 Anyone with a low-end old computer finds difficulty running directory brute forcing tools like Gobuster,Dirsearch(they are all good tools) .I indeed had
 had that problem as well . so i made a simple python script to do so . Pull requests are always welcome.

python3 dir.py -h
